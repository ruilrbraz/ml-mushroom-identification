    "# 🍄 Mushroom Identification Using Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "This project applies machine learning techniques to classify mushrooms as **edible or poisonous** based on their physical characteristics.\n",
    "The work follows a complete end-to-end data science workflow, from data preprocessing and model development to evaluation, visualization, and presentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📌 Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Correctly identifying poisonous mushrooms is a **safety-critical classification task**.\n",
    "This project explores multiple machine learning models and evaluation strategies to minimize dangerous misclassifications, particularly cases where poisonous mushrooms are incorrectly labeled as edible.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset consists entirely of categorical features and is well suited for tree-based and ensemble learning methods.\n",

    "## 🧠 Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Source:** Mushroom dataset (UCI)\n",
    "- **Samples:** 8,124 mushrooms\n",
    "- **Features:** Categorical physical attributes\n",
    "- **Target variable:**\n",
    "- `0` → Edible\n",
    "- `1` → Poisonous\n",
    "\n",
    "### Missing Values\n",
    "- Missing data was found in the `stalk-root` feature.\n",
    "- Missing values were handled by introducing a dedicated category (`\"m\"`), preserving potentially informative patterns rather than removing samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔧 Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "- Replacement of missing values with explicit category\n",
    "- One-hot encoding of all categorical features\n",
    "- `drop_first=True` used to avoid multicollinearity\n",
    "- Train/test split with stratification to preserve class balance\n",

    "## 🤖 Models Implemented\n",
    "\n",
    "The following models were trained and evaluated:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Logistic Regression** (baseline model)\n",
    "- **Decision Tree Classifier**\n",
    "- Unrestricted tree\n",
    "- Depth-limited tree (`max_depth`)\n",
    "- **Random Forest Classifier** (ensemble model)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔍 Hyperparameter Tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "Hyperparameter tuning was performed using **Grid Search with Cross-Validation**, focusing on:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Decision Tree:\n",
    "- `max_depth`\n",
    "- `min_samples_split`\n",

    "- `n_estimators`\n",
    "- `max_depth`\n",
    "- `min_samples_leaf`\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-validation ensured that model performance was robust and not dependent on a single train–test split.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📊 Evaluation Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "Model performance was evaluated using:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Accuracy\n",
    "- Precision, recall, and F1-score\n",
    "- Confusion matrices\n",
    "\n",
    "Special attention was given to **false negatives for the poisonous class**, as misclassifying a poisonous mushroom as edible represents a critical safety risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🏆 Key Results\n",
    "\n",
    "- Logistic Regression achieved high accuracy but produced a small number of dangerous misclassifications.\n",
    "- Decision Trees showed sensitivity to depth constraints, illustrating the bias–variance tradeoff.\n",
    "- **Random Forest achieved perfect classification on the test set**, eliminating all poisonous-to-edible errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Random Forest model was selected as the final model due to its robustness and superior safety performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "## 📈 Feature Importance\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature importance analysis revealed that a small number of features drive most predictions, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Odor\n",
    "- Spore print color\n",
    "- Gill characteristics\n",

    "\n",
    "- The dataset is clean and curated; real-world mushroom identification is more complex.\n",
    "- Models trained on this dataset should **not** replace expert judgment.\n",
    "- Machine learning systems should be used as **decision-support tools**, especially in safety-critical domains.\n",
